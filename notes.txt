Commands for setting up EKS:


eksctl create cluster --name capstone-demo --managed --node-type "t2.small" --nodes 2
kubectl apply -f deployment-template.yml
kubectl get services

if docker build an push succeeds, old one needs to be removed

The last command returns a external IP which you need just to paste into a browser, than everything works
